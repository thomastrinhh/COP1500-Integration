# COP1500-Integration
Project for COP1500.
Integration project for COP 1500 at Florida Gulf Coast University (Spring 2022)

For this project, we were to create one cohesive program throughout the semester that displays the skills we learned in COP 1500.
I chose to create a simple command line program that mainly specializes in solving simple mathematical problems.
The program also contains several guessing-based games that rely on the functions from the random module. 

## Project Requirements

### Sprint 1 Basic computation, simple I/O
- [x] Proper documentation
- [x] Simple I/O ('print()', formatting with 'end=' and 'sep=' arguments, 'input() functions')
- [x] Basic calculations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
- [x] String operators
- [x] Min. 50 lines of code

### Sprint 2 Standard conditional and iterative structures, the definitions of functions, and parameter passing
- [x] Integrate concepts from ACM/IEEE
- [x] Shortcut operators
- [x] Conditional structures/statements
- [x] Relational and boolean operators
- [x] Standard iterative structures ('while', 'for', 'range()', 'in')
- [x] Function definitions and parameter passing
- [x] Min. 100 lines of code

### Project Final
- [x] Enhance code quality/security (no warnings from PyCharm with PEP 8 style guide)
- [x] Enhance structure/style (adhere to PEP8 style guide)
- [x] Enhance documentation/comments (no missing or empty docstring warnings with Severity set to "Warning")
- [x] Improve user interface and consider human user factors (No crash when users input a string when a number is expected)
- [x] Must act as one unified, cohesive, integrated program that starts in main.py
- [x] Min. 150 lines of code

## Building & Installing
This program requires Python 3 in order to build upon. I used PyCharm IDE to write this program, but any other IDE/IDLE should be able to open this program just fine.

#### Instructions:

Clone a copy of this git repository by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomastrinhh/COP1500-Integration
```

Open `main.py` and compile (exact instructions vary by IDE/interpreter).
